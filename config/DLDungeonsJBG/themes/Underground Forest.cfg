# This determines the type of dungeon this should be, for the purpose of adding mobs through the API;
# Its basically like a biome dictionary for dungeons.  Valid values include DUNGEON, NECRO, URBAN, FOREST,
# PLAINS, MOUNTAIN, SWAMP, WATER, DESERT, WASTELAND, JUNGLE, FROZEN, FIERY, NETHER, END, MUSHROOM, MAGICAL,
# SHADOW, TECH, and PARADISE.  Most should have one or two types, not more than 3 or (very rarely) 4; API user
# should be more liberal with there assigning mosters to types, not the other way around.
